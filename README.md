# Credit Card Fraud Classification.

A machine learning pipeline capable of classifying the correct type of transaction with relative accuracy and then analyse the result.

This project ifs for helping me consolidate my machine learning classification knowlege into one project.
It will use a variaty of tecniques for feature reduction, classification and results analysis.

Building off of https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud/download Dataset.

Using a variaty of diffrent machine learning methods such as:
 - SVM
 - Deep Learning

## Instalation.
A requirements.txt file is included for easy pip installation of a dependencys.
Asides from that a jupyter notebook session would help in getting the project running.
